    "The World Settlement Footprint (WSF) dataset is a recent powerful tool for understanding areas of settlement\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualization we'll look at just the Red, Green and Blue channels and clip around Nepal. It was derived from multitemporal Sentinel-1 radar and Landsat-8 optical imagery and presents a binary classification of a pixel as representing a settlement (value=255) or not (value=0). The resolution is 0.32 arc seconds or approximately 10 meters!\n",
    "\n",
    "More information (and the data) are <a href=\"https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/World_Settlement_Footprint_WSF_2015/10048412\">available here</a> and by reading the original paper. {cite}`marconcini2020outlining`\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted earlier, this settlement data is representative of the conditions in 2015. So we will use this high-resolution special database to train our classifier, but will need to rely on our other data sources to see change over time after 2015.\n",
