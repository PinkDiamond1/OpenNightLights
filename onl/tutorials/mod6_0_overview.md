# Data fusion for image classification

After working through the previous modules of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of how to access, analyze and visualize satellite data. One of the best ways to improve your skills with data science and remote sensing (as with many things!) is to try hands-on examples.

## Economic activity in Nepal
This module presents an approach for assessing changes in built-up land cover in Nepal. In addition to using fundamental techniques introduced in the previous tutorial modules, participants will be exposed to two new concepts in the remote sensing domain: data fusion and image classification.

**Topics and activities include:**

{doc}`mod6_1_framing_the_analysis`: Designing analysis to provide meaningful insight into economic activity.

{doc}`mod6_2_supervised_learning_img_classification`: Intro to basic concepts of a powerful machine learning approach.

-Sentinel-2 (SE2) imagery
Intro to high-resolution daytime imagery for land monitoring.

-Merging SE2 bands with DMPS-OLS and VIIRS-DNB
Data fusion: integrating remote sensing data

-Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)
Using additional geospatial data as a label for training a classifier.

-Creating a training dataset with SE2, nighttime lights, and GHSL
Data fusion: integrating remote sensing data with other geospatial data.

-Training a Random Forest classifier
Application of supervised learning to classify built-up land cover.

-Model evaluation
Validating the model.

-Mapping annual changes in built-up land cover
Assessing and plotting change detection.
