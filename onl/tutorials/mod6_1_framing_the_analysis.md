# Framing the analysis

The most important work in any real-world problem-solving is framing your analysis in order to provide the most meaningful insights.

If you're working with data, this does not always mean your outcomes will be clear! If framed well; however, your analysis
can yield useful information no matter the outcome.

The scientific process and communicating about data for decision-makers are big but important topics for another tutorial. But some high level guidance for data anlysis is useful:
- What is the key inquiry we're trying to address?
- What are possible testable hypotheses that can help us to do that?
- What data will be useful for this?
- What methods will be useful for this?
- What conclusions will we draw from this?

## What is the key inquiry we're trying to address?

In our example, we're interested in assessing the economic activity in Nepal. That's pretty broad, so it helps to be specific. Let's frame our analysis around: **detecting changes in land cover that indicate changes in economic activity over the course of 5 years in the country of Nepal, from 2015 through 2019.**

These are big assumptions about land use and economic activity, so this is where the researcher will do extensive literature review to make sure this is a valid question and one that, if answered, actually helps the stakeholders gain insight or make decisions.

## What are possible testable hypotheses?

If our analysis was supporting important decisions, it would have to be very rigorous in answering if there was an observed effect. We will frame this as exploratory analysis, so we can be more relaxed, but it is still a good idea to set a threshold for what we are looking for **before** we look at the data. 

We will keep things simple. We are trying to detect change and we are making an assumption that land cover can proxy economic activity in a way that is useful for our stakeholders. Our testable hypothesis will be: **whether or not there are significant changes in land cover in Nepal in 2019 compared to 2014** The null hypothesis is that there is no change in either direction (growth or decline), a two-tailed hypothesis. Will our data be able to reject that?

## Data

With the analysis specified on land cover and the hypothesis set on temporal change, these are some considerations related to data:

- What is the research scope (i.e. measuring land cover) and what data or data products provide that?: we will explore daytime and nighttime imagery to get the 
- What specific source of data
