      <h1>World Bank - Light Every Night</h1>

<p></p>

<p>World Bank Light Every Night is a comprehensive data archive of nighttime light collected from two sensors over the last three decades: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Line-Scan System (OLS) with data from 1992-2017, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day-Night Band (DNB) with data spanning 2012-2020. The underlying data are sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/ National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) archive.</p>

<p>The DMSP-OLS and VIIRS-DNB sensors capture various sources of low-light emissions from Earth. These include sources that indicate aspects of human activity, like city lights, gas flares, fishing boats, and agricultural fires, while also capturing other nighttime lights phenomena such as auroras.</p>

<p>The World Bank worked in collaboration with NOAA/NCEI and the University of Michigan to publish this archive, designed from the ground up to be analysis-ready. The data are published in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF format (COG), and organized using the Spatial Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) standard. These standards are part of the growing Analysis Ready Data ecosystem that is improving access to geospatial data sets, enabling broader audiences to readily discover, process and analyze geospatial data. Analysis ready data has already undergone the transformations and preprocessing necessary to make data (in this case observations of electromagnetic energy collected in space!) organized and coherent for general technical users and analysts.

<h2 id="wb-len-data-structure">Light Every Night file structure</h2>

<p>The data for both DMSP-OLS and VIIRS-DNB are in the root AWS S3 bucket,  <code>s3://globalnightlight/</code>. DMSP-OLS data are organized by satellite name and year and VIIRS-DNB are organized by month.</p>

<h3 id="accessing-dmsp">DMSP-OLS</h3>

<p>DMSP-OLS data are organized by satellite name and year data were captured. The <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html">NOAA/NCEI website</a> provides a table of DMSP satellite name and year pairs. For example <code>s3://globalnightlight/F121995/</code> contains all data collected by satellite F12 in the year 1995.</p>

<p>Within a given sub-directory, data are provided for every day (night) of the given year. There are several types of files, with extensions indicating what data are contained within:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.tir.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing Thermal Infrared (TIR) data</li>
<li><code>.li.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing Lunar Illuminance (LI) </li>
<li><code>.samples.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing samples</li>
<li><code>.flag.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing a bitflag for data quality</li>
<li><code>.vis.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing a visible nighttime radiance (this is the key data file)</li>
<li><code>.vis.co.json</code>: a JSON file with metadata for the VIS file, including a timestamp and a geospatial bounding box</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, the stem of the filename corresponds with the satellite name, year, date and time (in UTC) of data collection. For example <code>F12199501010014.night.OIS.vis.co.tif</code> contains the visible nighttime radiance collected from the satellite F12 in 1995, on January 1, at 00 hours and 14 minutes. The bounding box geometry of the area covered in the file is available in the metadata within the corresponding JSON file and in the COG itself.</p>

<h3 id="accessing-viirs">VIIRS-DNB</h3>

<p>VIIRS-DNB data are organized by the year-month the data were captured. For example <code>s3://globalnightlight/201505/</code> contains all data collected in May of 2015.</p>

<p>As with DMSP-OLS, within a given sub-directory, data are provided for every day (night) of the given year. These files follow the naming convention and structure of Sensor Data Records as described in the <a href="https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/documents/documentation/viirs-users-guide-tech-report-142a-v1.3.pdf">VIIRS SDR User's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>For example, the naming convention for the file: <code>SVDNB_npp_d20150504_t1335358_e1341162_b18219_c20150504194116381040_noaa_ops.rade9.co.tif</code> is:</p>

<p>Prefix/product id (e.g. `SVDNB` for nighttime radiance), satellite (e.g. npp for Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership), date of data capture (e.g. d20150504), time of the scan start in hours, minutes and miliseconds (e.g. t1335358) and the end of the scan (e.g. e1341162), the orbit number (e.g. b18219), the file creation date/time (e.g. c20150504194116381040), the origin (e.g. noaa_ops), and an extension indicating data type (e.g. rade9.co.tif).</p>

<p>As with the DMSP data, there are several files containing different data:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.li.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing Lunar Illuminance (LI) </li>
<li><code>.samples.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing samples</li>
<li><code>.vflag.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing a bitflag for data quality</li>
<li>Prefix <code>SVM16</code> and extension <code>.rad.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing a visible image data from the VIIRS M16 band</li>
<li><code>.rade9.co.tif</code>: a COG with a single band containing a visible nighttime radiance (this is the key data file)</li>
<li><code>.rade9.co.json</code>: a JSON file with metadata for the nighttime radiance data, including a timestamp and a geospatial bounding box</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accessing-data-aws">Accessing Light Every Night data on AWS</h2>

<p>You can access these data via the link, <code>s3://globalnightligh</code> and using the web interface via the AWS console. Or via the AWS Command Line Interface, for example to list all files in the VIIRS 201505 sub-directory (using the <code>--no-sign-request</code> flag since this bucket is public:</p>

<p><code>aws s3 ls s3://globalnightlight/201505 --no-sign-request</code></p>
