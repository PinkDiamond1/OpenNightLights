Name: World Bank - Light Every Night
Description: Light Every Night - World Bank Nightime Light Data – the underlying data is sourced from the NOAA/NCEI archive. The two sensors featured are the DMSP-OLS with data from 1992-2017, and the VIIRS-DNB with data spanning 2012-2020. The World Bank worked in collaboration with NOAA/NCEI and the University of Michigan to publish the archive as an Analysis Ready Dataset in Cloud Optimized Geotiff (COG) format. The complete archive is about a petabyte of data, which is published and openly available under the terms of the World Bank’s open data license.
